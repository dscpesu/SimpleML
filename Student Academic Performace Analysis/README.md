## Introduction 📝

This project provides a dataset and a Streamlit dashboard for analyzing student achievement in secondary education in two Portuguese schools. The dataset includes various attributes related to student performance, demographics, social factors, and school-related features. The data was collected through school reports and questionnaires and has been used for classification and regression tasks in previous research.

## Dataset Description 📊

The dataset includes two separate datasets, one for student performance in Mathematics (mat) and another for Portuguese language (por). The target attribute of interest is G3, which represents the final year grade issued at the 3rd period. It's important to note that G3 is highly correlated with G2 (2nd-period grade) and G1 (1st-period grade), which are important predictors for G3.

Predicting G3 without G2 and G1 is challenging, but it can be a valuable task for educational analysis and interventions.

## Usage 🚀

### Dashboard 📈

We have created a Streamlit dashboard for easy exploration of the dataset and its insights. To use the dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python and Streamlit installed on your system. If not, you can install Streamlit using `pip`.

2. Clone this repository.

3. Run the Streamlit app.

The Streamlit app allows you to interactively explore the dataset, visualize data, and perform analyses on student achievement in secondary education.

## Data Attributes 📖

The dataset includes various attributes that provide valuable insights into student performance and other factors. Here are some of the key attributes:

- **G1**: 1st-period grade.
- **G2**: 2nd-period grade.
- **G3**: Final year grade (target variable).
- (Other attributes related to demographics, social factors, and school-related features.)

## Data Source 📦

The dataset used in this project was originally collected for educational research.
