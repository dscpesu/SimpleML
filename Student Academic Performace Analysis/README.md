## Introduction 📝

This project provides a dataset and a Streamlit dashboard for analyzing student achievement in secondary education in two Portuguese schools. The dataset includes various attributes related to student performance, demographics, social factors, and school-related features. The data was collected through school reports and questionnaires and has been used for classification and regression tasks in previous research.

## Dataset Description 📊

The data includes datasets, for student performance . The target attribute of interest is G3, which represents the final year grade issued at the 3rd period. It's important to note that G3 is highly correlated with G2 (2nd-period grade) and G1 (1st-period grade), which are important predictors for G3.

Predicting G3 without G2 and G1 is challenging, but it can be a valuable task for educational analysis and interventions.

## Usage 🚀

### Dashboard 📈

We have created a Streamlit dashboard for easy exploration of the dataset and its insights. To use the dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python and Streamlit installed on your system. If not, you can install Streamlit using `pip`.

2. Clone this repository.

3. Run the Streamlit app.

The Streamlit app allows you to interactively explore the dataset, visualize data, and perform analyses on student achievement in secondary education.

## Data Attributes 📖

The dataset includes various attributes that provide valuable insights into student performance and other factors. Here are some of the key attributes:

- **G1**: 1st-period grade.
- **G2**: 2nd-period grade.
- **G3**: Final year grade (target variable).
- (Other attributes related to demographics, social factors, and school-related features.)

## Data Source 📦

The dataset used in this project was originally collected for educational research.
