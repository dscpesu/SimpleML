# Phishing Domain Detection

This project is aimed at detecting phishing domains using machine learning models. It utilizes a dataset to train and test two distinct models: a Random Forest Classifier and a model generated by PyCaret's AutoML for comprehensive model comparison.

## Overview

Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information, often through deceptive emails or websites. This project aims to identify potential phishing domains by using machine learning algorithms on a provided dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models is stored in the `dataset` folder. It contains features and labels that are used to predict and classify phishing domains.

## Models

### 1. Random Forest Classifier

The first model in the `model` folder is based on a Random Forest Classifier. This model is specifically designed to classify and predict whether a domain is a phishing site or not.

### 2. PyCaret AutoML Model

The second model in the `model` folder is generated using PyCaret's AutoML. It provides an automated approach to compare various machine learning models and their performance on the dataset. The detailed comparison and the best-performing model are available in the PyCaret generated files.

## Usage

This project can be run using Google Colab notebooks. Each model's usage is outlined in separate Colab notebook cells within the project repository. Simply open the respective notebook for the model you want to use and follow the instructions provided in the notebook cells.

## Results

The results of model comparison and performance metrics are available in the PyCaret-generated files in the `PyCaret_AutoML_comparison_results` folder.
